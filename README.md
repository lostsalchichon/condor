Working modules:
- Drone detection
- Alarm activation
- Drone speed calculation aproximation
- Drone tracking
- Model detects many more classes, but only to ignore them (bird, plane, kite, person).
- Model crops, and saves detected drone to file.


Needed updates:
- Model crops, and saves detected+ignored objects
- Model trains itself using the self-made drone database.
- Model trains itself using the detected+ignored classes database.
- Radar downs drones.
